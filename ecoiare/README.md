# ♻️ Smart Waste Segregation & Recycling System

## 🚩 Problem
Every year, millions of tons of waste are generated. Most of it is **not properly segregated**:
- Recycling efficiency decreases
- Landfills overflow
- Soil, water, and air pollution increase

Large-scale waste management exists, but **citizen-level solutions** are critical for sustainable living.
